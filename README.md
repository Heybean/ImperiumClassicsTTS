# ImperiumClassicsTTS
This is a mod for Imperium Classics/Legends on Tabletop Simulator. I took Flop's scripted version of the mod and added more to it. This particular mod features a scripted setup (which came from Flop), a scripted market, scripted scoring, and some other features to aid solo play. I own none of the content in the mod except for the part of the lua scripts that I wrote.
